the is the Second Assignment in Software engineering course

the program goal is to calculate the time and the performance of the sequential processing of the matrix multiplication algorithm
input: the number of the rows and the colmns for each matrix
output: the multiplication of the two generated matrices, the time in nanosecond, and the performance


to compile the code type    make

to run the code type     make run    and the arguments
for example 
            make run ROW1=3 COL1=3 ROW2=3 COL2=3

to test any function add it to the test source code and then run the test by typing
           make test
